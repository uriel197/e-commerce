***1: Session Check Logic:Added useDispatch and useSelector to access the Redux store and dispatch actions.
Added a useEffect hook that runs on app load and whenever user changes.
The checkSession function checks if user exists in state.userState (from localStorage via getUserFromLocalStorage).
If user exists, it sends a fetch GET request to /api/v1/users/check-session with credentials: "include" to include the signed cookie.
If the response is successful (response.ok), the session is valid, and no action is needed.
If the response fails (e.g., 401 Unauthorized due to missing/expired cookie), it:Logs the error.
Shows a toast.error message to inform the user.
Dispatches logoutUser to clear state.userState.user, reset state.userState.theme to "cupcake", remove localStorage.user, and update localStorage.theme.

Integration with Existing Setup:The code works with your userSlice (from previous conversations), which defines logoutUser to reset the state and localStorage.
It uses fetch (no axios) and relies on your cookie-based authentication (req.signedCookies.token verified by authenticateUser middleware).
It integrates with your GlobalProvider, QueryClientProvider, and React Router setup without modifying routing or other functionality.

User Feedback:The toast.error notifies the user when their session expires, improving UX by explaining why they’re redirected to log in.
The logoutUser action ensures the UI updates to reflect the logged-out state (e.g., Navbar shows “Guest” instead of the user’s name).
