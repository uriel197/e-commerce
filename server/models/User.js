/*************** COMMENTS **************

***1: ^: Asserts the start of the line.
(...): Groups multiple patterns together.
([^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*): This part checks for the local part of the email address (before the @ symbol). 
[^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@"] : 
the allowed characters in the first portion of the email address are any characters except the ones listed in the set [<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]
(\.[^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*: This part allows for a dot followed by more characters that are not within the set [<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"], dots are allowed in the first part of the email address before the "@" symbol, both in unquoted and quoted strings.
|: Acts as an OR operator.
(".+"): This part checks for a quoted string as the local part of the email address. The regular expression allows for two main formats in the local part of the email address: quoted strings and Unquoted strings.
@: Matches the @ symbol.
(...): Groups multiple patterns together.
(\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\]): This part checks for an IP address within square brackets.
|: Acts as an OR operator.
(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}): This part checks for the domain part of the email address. It allows for alphanumeric characters and hyphens, followed by a dot, and then at least two letters for the top-level domain. TLD, short for top-level domain, is the last segment of a domain name â€“ the part that comes after the final dot. The most common example is .com
$: Asserts the end of the line.

***2: we write the word "function" after the async word in order to have access to the "this" keyword which refers to the user. arrow functions dont allowed the "this" keyword.
